# COVID-19 Detector
Live: https://covid-19-xray-diagnose.herokuapp.com/

A web application that uses machine learning to determine whether a user has tested positive or negative for COVID-19 based on a chest X-ray image.

This was done by using Tensorflow to develop a Convolutional Neural Network in Python that classified images as "positive" or "negative" with a 97% accuracy. The Tensorflow model was trained using the COVID-19 Radiography Database dataset found here on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
